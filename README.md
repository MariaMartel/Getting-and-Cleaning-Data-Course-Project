# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository contains the files of the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course Project, id est:
* The script for performing the analysis of the data set: run_analysis.R.
* The code book that describes the variables, the data, and other work needed to clean up the data, called CodeBook.md.
* The two data sets generated by the R script: "merg_clean_data.txt" and "tidy_data_set_with_averages.txt"

The goal is to prepare a tidy data from the original data downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
(The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
